OBJECTIVE : Our objective is to route a droplet from source to sink by bypassing all the obstracles in minimum Time.Here we proposed ILP fromulation for that droplet routing for Square chip electrode.

    • We use cross-referencing Biochip, which allows the control of an N × M grid array with only N + M control pins

ELECTRODE ACTIVATION CONSTRAINT
    • EC – I : If droplet is at cell (x,y) at time t then the four diagonal a	     djacent cell cannot be activated at time t+1.
    • EC – II : If the droplet moves from cell (Xt ,Yt) to cell (Xt+1 ,Yt+1) 	      from time t to t+1 then all the 8 neighbouring cell of 		      (Xt+1 ,Yt+1) can’t be activated at t+1.

Objective Function :
	The goal is to minimize the latest time the droplet reaches to it’s sink.
	minimize : Tl 

Constraints of basic ILP formulation:

1. source requirement:
	we assume that the droplet is present at its source location at time 0
	C(Sx,Sy,0) = 1 

2. Sink requirement:
	The droplet must reach its sink. 
	>= 1

	If the droplet reach its sink it should remains there. (Let the droplet 	reaches it’s sink at time t then it shoud be there at time t+1)
	C(SKx,Sky,t) – C(SKx,Sky,t+1) <= 0
								0<= t <T

3. Exclusivity constraint:
	At each time stamp droplet can present only at one location (as we are 	moving droplet from one location to oter location we don’t want to split 	the droplet)
	= 1
						 , 0<= t < T

4. Droplet transportation Time :
	if the droplet reaches it’s sink at time t+1 , then the time when it reaches 	its sink can be computed as t+1 times difference between C(x,y,t+1) and 	C(x,y,t)
	(t+1)((x,y,t+1)  - (x,y,t) ) <= Tl 		, 0<= t < T

5. static fludic constraints :
	The droplet should’t present in the obstracle cell at any point of time
	 = 0   ,				0<= t < T

6. Dynamic fludic constraints :
	when droplet moves it should’t enter into any obstracle cell. If a droplet 	present in cell (x,y) at time t (Which is definately not an obstracle cell) it 	should’t move to any obstracle cell at time t+1.
	C(x,y,t) +   <= 1		,0<= t < T
	droplet can move any one of it’s four adjacent cell at time t+1 (droplet 	can’t stall)
	C(x,y,t) +  <= 2           ,0<= t < T

7. Voltage assignment and cell activation:
	Each row/column can be assigned one voltage (high or low) at any time. 	
	LXC(t) + HXC(t) <= 1  		0 ≤ x < W, 0 ≤ t < T
	Lyr(t) + Hyr(t) <= 1		0 ≤ y < H, 0 ≤ t < T

	A cell is activated if and only if it is in the intersection of a row with 	high (low) voltage and a column with low (high) voltage. 
	(LXC(t) and Hyr(t)) or (HXC(t) and Lyr(t)) <-> atx,y	∀(x, y) ∈ C, 0 ≤ t < T
	
	We use the following five equations and two additional variables to 	linearize constraint.

	LXC(t) + Hyr(t) – 2b1x,y(t) >= 0 	[0+0-0 ,1+0-0,0+1-0,1+1-2]
	LXC(t) + Hyr(t) – b1x,y(t) <= 1		[0+0-0 ,1+0-0,0+1-0,1+1-1]
	HXC(t) + Lyr(t) – 2b2x,y(t) >= 0
	HXC(t) + Lyr(t) – b2x,y(t) <= 1

	cell (x,y) is activated then either b1x,y(t) = 1 or b2x,y(t) = 1 , but not both
	atx,y - b1x,y(t) – b2x,y(t) = 0

	b1x,y(t) = 1 means,  cell (x,y) is activated and the column x is assigned to 	low voltage and row y is assigned to high voltage.
	b2x,y(t) = 1 means,  cell (x,y) is activated and the column x is assigned to 	high voltage and row y is assigned to low voltage.
	Both b1x,y(t)  and b2x,y(t)  can’t be 1 at a time.




8. Eletrode constraint:
	EC – I 
		C(x,y,t) + at+1x’,y’ <= 1
							(x’,y’) ∈D(x,y)   , 0 <= t < T

	EC – II
		C(x,y,t) + at+1x’,y’ <= 1   		(x’,y’) ∈E8(Xt+1,Yt+1) ,  0 <= t < T

		(cell (x,y) is active at time t, and the droplet moves to cell (xt+1,yt+1) 		at time t+1, then all the eight adjacent cell of (xt+1,yt+1) must be 			deactivated at time t+1 	)
